# InteractiveGemSwapScreen
This program launches an interactive screen which allows for the gem icons to be manipulated with the mouse and keys. 

Opening the index.html with Google Chrome launches the interactive screen.

By clicking the mouse on one gem, holding and releasing on another gem, the two gems will swap positions if the swap creates
a sequence of three or more identical gems. 

Clicking a gem while holding B will eliminate the gem. 
Holding Q will shake the screen and randomly eliminate gems. 
Holding A will rotate the gem array counterclockwise. Holding D will rotate the gem array clockwise.
